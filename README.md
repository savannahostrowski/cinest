# Cinest ðŸŽ¥

A movie suggestion engine, built with love and Azure! This is a demo application for showcasing the new `azd init` flow!

## Local development
Dependencies:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- Node 18.16+

### Frontend
1. Run `npm install` in `frontend/`
1. Run `npm run dev` to start dev server

### API
You will need API keys for [OMDb API](https://ombdapi.com/) (free!) and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview). Once you get these, store them in a `.env` file in the root of the project as `OMDB_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
1. Create venv or open in Dev Container
1. Install deps via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. In root of project (`/`), run `docker-compose up` to run the API and database in containers for local development


## Azure Developer CLI
This project was made Azure Developer CLI-compatible using the new `azd init` flow, which detects your local app stack and generates the right configuration to get the application up and running on Azure.

To try it out, checkout the `not-azdified` branch and run `azd init` in the directory with the project and go through these steps:
1. Enable buildpack support (needed for front-end)
1. Postgres DB is not automatically detected so you need to add it manually during the init flow
1. Port is configured to 8080 in the `frontend.bicep`, you will need to update to 5173 for Vite
1. Error on backend container in log stream (connection refused by asyncpg) --> update env variables in `api.bicep` to match what I'm looking for in my app for the DB
1. Error on fronend container in log stream (Oryx workspace/ not found in the container) --> add a start script in `package.json` to run `npm run dev -- --host` (this feels hacky and probably suboptimal??)
1. Need to reference the API keys for OMDb and OpenAI:
    - Copy the contents of your `.env` into the `.azure/<env name>/.env` file
    - Add them to `main.parameters.json` 
    - Add params for the keys in `main.bicep`
    - Pass params into `api.bicep` module
    - use in `api.bicep` secrets
1. Needed to update paths for API requests in front-end to use back-end container URL

### Bonus: Configuring a custom domain!
1. Go to frontend container app in portal
1. Go to custom domains
1. Click Add Custom Domain
1. Select use managed certificate (preview)
1. Enter domain name
1. Add records to validate
1. Once created, grab the name from the certificate used field
1. Take that and update the frontend.bicep and add lines 114-117 with your name
1. Reference in properties for container under `properties.configuration.ingress.customDomains` (lines 64-70) but replace with your own domain name
