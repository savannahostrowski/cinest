A movie suggestion engine, built with love and Azure!

## Local development
Dependencies:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- Node 18.16+

### Frontend
1. Run `npm install` in `frontend/`
1. Run `npm run dev` to start dev server

### API
You will need API keys for [OMDb API](https://ombdapi.com/) (free!) and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview). Once you get these, store them in a `.env` file in the root of the project as `OMDB_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
1. Create venv or open in Dev Container
1. Install deps via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. In root of project (`/`), run `docker-compose up` to run the API and database in containers for local development

## Try out the new Azure Developer CLI easy `init` flow!
This project was made Azure Developer CLI-compatible using the new `azd init` flow, which detects your local app stack and generates the right configuration to get the application up and running on Azure.

To try it out, checkout the `not-azdified` branch and run `azd init` in the directory with the project and walk through the wizard. This feature is experimental and in alpha stage. Currently this project still requires these manual configurations:

1. Update `DB_` env variables in `api.bicep` to match what's used in the docker-compose file
1. Need to reference the API keys for OMDb and OpenAI:
    - Copy the contents of your `.env` into the `.azure/<env name>/.env` file
    - Add them to `main.parameters.json` 
    - Add params for the keys in `main.bicep`
    - Pass params into `api.bicep` module
    - use in `api.bicep` secrets

### Bonus: Configuring a custom domain!
azd doesn't handle this today but
1. Go to frontend container app in portal
1. Go to custom domains
1. Click Add Custom Domain
1. Select use managed certificate (preview)
1. Enter domain name
1. Add records to validate
1. Once created, grab the name from the certificate used field
1. Take that and update the frontend.bicep and add lines 114-117 with your name
1. Reference in properties for container under `properties.configuration.ingress.customDomains` (lines 64-70) but replace with your own domain name
