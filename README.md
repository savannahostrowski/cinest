## Local development
Dependencies:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- Node 18.16+

### Frontend
1. Run `npm install` in `frontend/`
1. Run `npm run dev` to start dev server on `localhost:5173`

### API
You will need API keys for [OMDb API](https://ombdapi.com/) (free!) and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview). Once you get these, store them in a `.env` file in the root of the project as `OMDB_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
1. Create venv or open in Dev Container
1. Install deps via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. In root of project (`/`), run `docker-compose up` to run the API and database in containers for local development

## Try out the new Azure Developer CLI easy `init` flow!
This project was made Azure Developer CLI-compatible using the new `azd init` flow, which detects your local app stack and generates the right configuration to get the application up and running on Azure.

To try it out, checkout the `not-azdified` branch and run `azd init` in the directory with the project and walk through the wizard.

To configure env vars after generation, you should add your API keys to the `.azure/<env name>/.env` file and then add them to the `main.parameters.json` file.
